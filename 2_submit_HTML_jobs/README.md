# Node.js Execution Guide for HDOCK Upload Script

This guide explains how to set up and execute the Node.js scripts for uploading receptor and ligand files via HDOCK.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (v12 or later) installed.  
  Check your version with:
  ```bash
  node -v


## Script Overview
# File Handling
Input Directories:

Receptors: Files are expected in the directory:
../data/receptor_pdbs/
(Only PDB files are processed)

Ligands: Files are expected in the directory:
../data/ligand_pdbs/
(Only PDB files are processed)

Additional Folders for Submission Jobs:

To ensure you do not exceed the allowable job submissions relative to your email rotation limits, please create the following folders in your data directory:

submit_jobs_receptors
submit_jobs_ligands
Place the appropriate receptor and ligand files for submission inside these folders. This helps in segregating the files meant for job submissions from other files.

# File Processing

Batch Processing:
The script automatically processes each receptor-ligand pair, preparing the necessary POST requests.

Supported Files:
Supports both standard PDB files and custom AlphaFold-derived structure files.

Local Logging:
A CSV file (responses.csv) is generated (and updated) to record the outcome of each submission.


## Script Handling
# Submission Workflow
#Request Preparation

Generates POST requests for each receptor-ligand pair

Attaches files as multipart/form-data

Email rotation every 10 submissions

# Job Submission

javascript
Copy
fetch('http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/submit', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
Error handling for failed submissions

Automatic retry mechanism

# Logging & Tracking

CSV output (responses.csv) contains:

Column	Description
Timestamp	Submission time
ReceptorFile	PDB filename
LigandFile	PDB filename
HDOCK_Response	Server response text

## New Submission
You can re-run the code. OR if you have mistakes, use the bugsfixes.py to analyse which job_IDs were problematic, and recreate your folders.
